This repository contains solutions to some of the codechef problems.
The solutions are currently implemented in C++ alone

The code can be compiled by running the 
g++ <file_name> -o <executable_name>

The executable can be test for test cases by running it
./<executable_name>

You can ease your testing efforts by providing a file input to the executable through "<" operator.
