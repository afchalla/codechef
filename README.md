This repository contains solutions to some of the codechef problems.
The solutions are currently implemented in C++ alone

The code can be compiled by running the 
g++ *fileName* -o *executableName*

The executable can be test for test cases by running it
./*executableName*

You can ease your testing efforts by providing a file input to the executable through "<" operator.
